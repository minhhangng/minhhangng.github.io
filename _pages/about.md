I am third-year Ph.D. student at IRIF, Universite Paris Cite, working with Pierre Fraigniaud and Mikael Rabie. Before, I got my Master from a research master program [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) in Paris, and my Bachelor in Mathematics from [Hanoi National University of Education](https://english.hnue.edu.vn). This is my [CV](files/CV-2.pdf).


Research Interest
======
My current research interest is on distributed network computing and dynamic graphs. Specifically, I work on complexity of distributed agreement tasks using tools from combinatorial topology. I am also working on dynamic graphs including forbidden patterns, coloring, and Cannadian Traveller Problem.
