This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

About me
======
I am third year Phd student at IRIF, Universite Paris Cite, working with Pierre Fraigniaud and Mikael Rabie. Before, I got my Master from research master program in Paris [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php), and my Bachelor in Mathematics from [Hanoi National University of Education](https://english.hnue.edu.vn). This is my [CV](files/CV-2.pdf)

My current reseach interest is on distributed network computing and dynamic graphs. Specifically, I work on complexity of distributed agreement tasks using tools from combinatorial topology. Other topics on dynamic graphs that I am working on includes forbidden patterns, coloring, and Cannadian Traveller Problem.
