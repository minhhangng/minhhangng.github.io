======
I am third year Phd student at IRIF, Universite Paris Cite, working with Pierre Fraigniaud and Mikael Rabie. Before, I got my Master from research master program in Paris [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php), and my Bachelor in Mathematics from [Hanoi National University of Education](https://english.hnue.edu.vn). This is my [CV](minhhangng.github.io/files
/CV-2.pdf)

My current reseach interest is on distributed network computing and dynamic graphs. Specifically, I work on complexity of distributed agreement tasks using tools from combinatorial topology. Other topics on dynamic graphs that I am working on includes forbidden patterns, coloring, and Cannadian Traveller Problem.
